Sample code from which examples were extracted during the Google I/O 19 talk on
AMP for e-commerce. Only one page is included, the home page. This code will
be replaced by better demos on [amp.dev](https://amp.dev/).

This project took the CAMP e-commerce demo (see
[go.amp.dev/camp-code](https://go.amp.dev/camp-code)] and
[camp.samples.amp.dev](https://camp.samples.amp.dev/)) that uses Mustache
partials, beginning the work to convert the larger partials into finer grain
components.

To use this project, run

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn run dev
```
