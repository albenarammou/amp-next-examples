Sample code from which examples were extracted during the Google I/O 19 talk on
AMP for e-commerce. Only one page is included, the home page. This code will
be replaced by better demos on [amp.dev](https://amp.dev/).

This project took the code of another project
[morsssss/amp-ecomm](https://github.com/morsssss/amp-ecomm) that uses AMP
Mustache partials, beginning the work to convert the larger partials into
finer grain components.

To use this project, run

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn run dev
```
